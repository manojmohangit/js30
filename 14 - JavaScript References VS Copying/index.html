    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    //const clonedPlayers = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // clonedPlayers[2] = "Dope"
    // console.log(`Players: ${players}`)
    // console.log(`ClonedPlayers ${clonedPlayers}`)
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    // const newArrayPlayers = new Array(players);
    var spliceArrayPlayers = players.slice();
    spliceArrayPlayers[2] = "Dope"
    console.log(`Players: ${players}`)
    console.log(`ClonedPlayers ${spliceArrayPlayers}`)

    var newArrayPlayers = [].concat(players);
    newArrayPlayers[2] = "Dope"
    console.log(`Players: ${players}`)
    console.log(`ClonedPlayers ${newArrayPlayers}`)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    var spreadPlayers = [...players];
    spreadPlayers[2] = "Dope"
    console.log(`Players: ${players}`)
    console.log(`ClonedPlayers ${spreadPlayers}`)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // var person1 = person;
    // person1.age = 90
    // console.log(person, person1)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    var person2 = Object.assign({}, person);
    person2.age = 90
    console.log(person, person2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    var person3 = {...person};
    person3.age = 70
    person3.status = "Using Spread"
    console.log(person, person3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
